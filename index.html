								<h3 class="section-title">1. Introduction: Addressing the Food Waste Challenge</h3>
								<p class="section-text">
									Food waste is a pressing global concern with profound environmental, economic, and social impacts. 
									It accounts for nearly <strong>8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions</strong>, contributes to food 
									insecurity, and results in an **economic loss estimated at $1 trillion annually**. Governments, organisations, 
									and researchers are actively exploring innovative ways to mitigate this issue.
									<br><br>
									One approach gaining traction is <strong>social media analysis</strong>, which provides valuable insights 
									into public perception, discussions, and sentiments about food waste. This study leverages 
									<strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> and data science techniques to explore food waste 
									conversations on Twitter, aiming to identify key themes, emotions, and priority areas for intervention.

								<p>Angry tweets about food waste spiked in March 2020, coinciding with a drop in joy tweets (17% to 13%). 
								Similar fluctuations in anger were observed throughout the period, though with variability. 
								By 2021, anger levels fell below 2019 levels, while sadness increased from 13% in 2020 to 16% in 2021. 
								Towards the end of 2021, joy tweets surged, while sadness, fear, and anger declined. 
								Surprise and disgust remained low overall, though **disgust spiked in June 2019, January 2021, and August 2021.</p>

									Informal housing refers to unregulated, often undocumented living arrangements, including shared rooms, subletting, and makeshift dwellings. 
									This study provides a data-driven attempt to document and analyse informal housing trends across Australian cities, highlighting:
								</p>
								<ul class="results-list">
									<li>A massive demand-supply gap.</li>

									I began my career as a Quality Assurance Analyst at TechMahindra Ltd. in India, where I collaborated with stakeholders, developers, and business analysts to gather requirements, design test plans, execute manual testing, and report defects. This role gave me a broader and deeper understanding of systems, pushing me to think critically about potential failure points and their impact on clients.
									<br/><br/>
									Driven by problem-solving, I built an in-house automation tool that reduced 80% of manual efforts in testing SOAP services for defect fixes. This innovation led me to a Software Developer role in the Automotive Retail-Dealership sector, where I worked with an incredible team that helped me refine my software development skills, system design, integration, and agile practices.
									<br/><br/>
									My passion for Artificial Intelligence (AI) dates back to 2009 when I first encountered the concept in my studies. The idea of building intelligent systems that can mimic human behaviour fascinated me. With a strong desire to explore AI further, I migrated to Australia and completed a Master’s in Computing (Advanced) at the Australian National University.
									<br/><br/>
									This led me to a Data Scientist role at Monash Data Futures Institute (Monash University), where I collaborated with leading researchers and universities across Australia. I worked on data-driven, evidence-based analytics systems aimed at helping policymakers design impactful intervention strategies. This experience broadened my perspective, allowing me to solve problems beyond commercial settings and engage in social impact work.
									<br/><br/>
									AI is vast, with immense potential to drive both business and societal change. I am eager to expand my expertise and explore opportunities where AI can be leveraged ethically and responsibly for societal benefit.
									<br/><br/>
									I’d love to connect with like-minded professionals to exchange ideas and collaborate. Feel free to send me a message—I look forward to engaging with you!
